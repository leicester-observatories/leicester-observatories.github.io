Welcome to the University of Leicester observatories!

We have two research telescopes that are used for research projects, undergraduate studies, and public outreach. For technical information about them please see the **LINK Information LINK** page, and for a collection of images produced by some of our students you can browse the [Gallery]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link pages/gallery.md %})


During the winter months (October - April) we aim to run public open nights monthly (weather permitting!). These events are **free and open to anyone**, so if you would like to come visit the facility please [contact us](mailto:observatories@leicester.ac.uk) and we can add you to the mailing list. You will be notified when tickets are released - these events are usually very popular so make sure you get your tickets quickly!


We also offer visits for local groups, including Scouts, Guides, schools, clubs, and astronomy groups. If you would like to organise an observing night for your group, get in contact! Please note there is a fee for these events just to cover the demonstrators time both on the night and prior for preparation.
