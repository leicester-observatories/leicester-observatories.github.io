Currently in our two observatories there is a [20 inch planewave CDK20 telescope](https://planewave.com/products/cdk20-f6-8-ota/) named πCETL in one observatory & a 12 inch Meade LX200 Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope in the other. It is one of the UK's largest and most advanced astronomical teaching facilities. The details for both of the telescopes and the CCD camera on the planewave telescope can be found below.
